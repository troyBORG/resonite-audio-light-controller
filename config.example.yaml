# Resonite Audio Light Controller Configuration

# ResoniteLink port - asked at startup if not set. Only the world host runs ResoniteLink (localhost).
# resonite_port: 27404

# Parent slot for lights (e.g. DJ booth slot ID). Omit or null to parent under Root.
# parent_slot_id: "Reso_XXXX"

# Center position offset - shifts all zone positions (e.g. around DJ booth at 0,0,0)
center:
  x: 0
  y: 0
  z: 0

# Light rotation - spins lights around Y axis, optionally synced to bass
rotation_enabled: false
rotation_speed: 30          # degrees per second (base)
rotation_audio_boost: true  # boost speed with bass

# Audio source: "speakers" (system output), "microphone", or path to audio file
audio_source: speakers
# audio_source: microphone
# audio_source: "/path/to/your/music.mp3"
# For speakers: PipeWire/Pulse source by name (run: pactl list sources short)
audio_pulse_source: "alsa_output.pci-0000_0b_00.1.hdmi-stereo.monitor"
# For microphone: audio_monitor_output: Yeti  or  audio_device: 8 (from --list-devices)

# Sample rate for audio processing (Hz)
sample_rate: 44100

# FFT window size (higher = more frequency resolution, less time resolution)
fft_size: 2048

# Light layout - number of lights per zone
# Directions: left, right, front, back, top, bottom
# The program creates exactly this many lights and generates matching control signals
layout:
  left: 5
  right: 5
  front: 3
  back: 2
  top: 4
  bottom: 0

# Default pattern: chase, chase_reverse, swirl, front_to_back, back_to_front,
#   left_off, right_off, left_right_alt, center_out, upper_bass, bass_flood,
#   beat_hue (hue jumps on beat),
#   treble_hue, band_split, music_color, breathing, all_on, zone_mix
default_pattern: chase

# zone_mix: different pattern per zone, cycles every zone_cycle_seconds
# zone_mix_sets:
#   - { top: chase, left: left_off, right: right_off, front: bass_flood, back: center_out }
#   - { top: center_out, left: chase, right: chase, front: left_right_alt, back: music_color }
# zone_cycle_seconds: 14

# Chase pattern: tail length (lights in the "tail" of the chase)
chase_tail: 3

# Update rate for lighting (Hz) - how often we send updates to Resonite
update_rate: 30
